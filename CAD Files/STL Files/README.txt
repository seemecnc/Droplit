38710 M5 Anti Backlash nut is used with M5x0.8 threaded rod and two TALL M5 nuts
One is sunk in the bottom of the part, then a spring (TBD) is put over the rod and
a second nut is then threaded on, and the spring takes out any backlash

You can just print Droplit_Plate.STL for all the required parts.
